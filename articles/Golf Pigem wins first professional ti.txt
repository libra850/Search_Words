Spain's Carlos Pigem claimed his first professional title after bcoding Japan's Shunya Takeyasu in a play-off at the $500,000 Yeangder Tournament Players Championship in Taiwan.With a four-day total of 12-under-par 276, Pigem and Takeyasu battled it out at the Linkou International Golf and Country Club.The 25-year-old Spaniard gained confidence early in the play-off when his second shot on the par-five 18 landed in the middle of the fairway while Takeyasu's fell into the rough.An emotional Pigem knew the title was his when the Japanese's fourth shot only touched the edge of the green."Play-offs are always going to be a 50-50 affair," said Pigem, who turned pro in 2013."I'm really at a loss for words. I cried when I sunk that birdie putt on the play-off hole," he added."That feeling of winning my first professional title here at the Yeangder TPC is simply indescribable," he said.Australia's Scott Barr who took a solo third-round lead finished tied for third place with Malaysia's Nicholas Fung.Â
