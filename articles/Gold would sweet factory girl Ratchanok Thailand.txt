Ratchanok has had injury troubles and dips in form since her world title but has been in ominous condition in recent months, capturing three consecutive Superseries tournaments to rise to the world number one ranking in April.She has since conceded it to Spain's two-time world champion Carolina Marin but her brief spell at the top sent Thailand into a frenzy.Rather than shy away from the hype, Ratchanok has embraced the expectation."I hope that I can get the gold medal for Thailand," said Ratchanok, standing on a terrace at her hotel adjacent to Olympic stadiums built for the 2000 Sydney Games."It's not too difficult for me and I believe that I can do it."Ratchanok had an unusual route into badminton, being handed a racquet at the age of six and told to go play outside the factory where her parents worked making sweet Thai desserts.Her tournament winnings and endorsements have been enough to help her parents start their own food business, while her achievements have won her friends in high places.After becoming Thailand's first world number one, Ratchanok played a game with Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha during a visit to government house.During the meeting she asked him if her Chinese coach's application to become a Thai citizen could be expedited, local media reported.Xie Zhuhua, who once battled China's current head coach Li Yongbo during competition in the 1990s, has coached Ratchanok since her junior days and is seen as key to her ability to unlock the games of her Chinese rivals."He just takes care of me like I'm his daughter, because he also doesn't have (one)," Ratchanok said of their special relationship."He loves me like a daughter and takes care of me. For me, he's like a second father, so I just do my best."
