er," Messi said.<br/>"We've been in spectacular form up to now. Now it's up to us to do it again on Sunday. We don't feel any pressure. We're used to playing in finals -- unfortunately we haven't won one yet."Messi, who became Argentina's all-time leading goalscorer with his 55th international goal in the semi-final win over the United States, will need to find a way through a fiercely combative Chilean side who are busily plotting another ambush.Argentina defeated Chile 2-1 during the group stage earlier this month, but have improved steadily as the tournament progressed.A 7-0 destruction of Mexico in the quarter-finals was followed by a clinical 2-0 dispatching of Colombia in the last four."They are a team that presses you, and don't let you play," Messi said in comments to reporters on Friday. "And when they have the ball they play very well."Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said "La Roja" would have a plan ready to contain Messi, making it likely that the spiky midfield qualities of Gary Medel will be deployed to keep the Argentinian captain in check."Playing against the most transcendental player in history is going to be no easy task," Pizzi said on Saturday."We're going to use whatever weapons we can to stop our opponent's actions, and of course, within these strategies there is the question of Messi," he added.Sunday's final brings the curtain down on the first Copa America to be staged outside South America.The 16-team tournament comprising sides from throughout the Americas is being held to celebrate the centenary of the Copa America, which was first staged in 1916.
