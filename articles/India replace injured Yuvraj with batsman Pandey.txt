World Twenty20 hosts India have replaced injured all-rounder Yuvraj Singh with middle-order batsman Manish Pandey, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Wednesday.Yuvraj, who played a crucial role in India's victory in the inaugural edition of the tournament in 2007, twisted his ankle while batting during Sunday's six-wicket victory over Australia that secured India's place in the last four of the tournament.Pandey, 26, will fancy his chances of playing when India take on 2012 champions West Indies in the second semi-final at the Wankhede Stadium on Thursday, even though Ajinkya Rahane will also stake his claim for a place in the starting side.Pandey, who is the first batsman from his country to smash a century in the Indian Premier League (IPL) Twenty20 competition, has played only four one-day internationals and a couple of T20 internationals.
