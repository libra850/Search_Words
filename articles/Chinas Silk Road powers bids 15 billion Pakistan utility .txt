"We are getting a lot more enquiries from Chinese investors about Pakistan in the last couple of years," said Muhammad Sohail, CEO at Karachi-based brokerage Topline Securities."Before it was always U.S. and Europe. The Chinese are coming," Sohail added.Still, foreign investment in Pakistan remains relatively muted as it struggles to shake off a reputation for violence, corruption and instability, and despite the $250 billion economy growing at its fastest pace in eight years.Inbound M&amp;A into Pakistan has risen more than six times in the past five years, totaling $516 million so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters data.K-Electric, Pakistan's biggest electricity startup, supplies power to over 2.2 million customers in and around Karachi, the country's biggest and wealthiest city.The utility has undergone a turnaround since Abraaj bought it; K-Electric has cut down on electricity theft and reduced outages."Abraaj has done a good job but for a newcomer to get involved in a city like Karachi is not easy," said the Karachi-based adviser, referring to a city where power theft, violence and political turmoil have scared investors away."The Chinese are looking at a lot of things but they are also very cautious."Sources said some Pakistani firms were also bidding, but it was not clear how keen they were, and they would likely find it tough to match the Chinese in an auction which could go as high as $2 billion.China Southern Power Grid declined comment, while Shanghai Electric Power confirmed it was bidding but gave no details.A K-Electric spokeswoman said the startup had not been notified about any transaction or acquisition. "We dismiss these rumors as speculative," she said. A spokeswoman at Abraaj declined comment.Though Pakistan is courting Chinese investment, some deals have faced roadblocks.In 2005, an Etisalat-led consortium agreed to pay $2.6 billion for 26 percent of Pakistan Telecommunication Co, but the Abu Dhabi-listed operator has withheld some money due to differences with the government on outstanding ownership of properties.
