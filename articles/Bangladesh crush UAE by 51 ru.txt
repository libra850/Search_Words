Bangladesh defeated United Arab Emirates (UAE) by 51 runs in the third Twenty20 International of the Asia Cup 2016 here at the Shere Bangla National Stadium, Mirpur on Friday.This was Bangladeshs first victory from two matches while the UAE lost both the matches they have played so far in the tournament.Chasing a rather easy target of 134, the UAE made a pathetic start as their wickets were falling quickly and the whole team were bundled out for a mere 82 in 16.5 overs.Only three batsmen could get into the double figures as Muhammad Usman top scored with 30, followed by Rohan Mustafa (18) and Mohammad Shahzad (12).For Bangladesh, Mahmudullah, Mashrafe Mortaza, Mustafizur Rehman and Shakib Al Hasan bagged two wickets each for just five, 12, 13 and 20 runs, respectively.Taskin Ahmed and Al-Amin Hossain, who opened the bowling attack, claimed one wicket each.Earlier, Bangladesh made 133 for eight after being put into bat by the UAE captain Amjad Javed.Opener Mohammad Mithun top scored with 47, followed by an unbeaten 36 by middle-order batsman Mahmudullah while only two other batsmen Soumya Sarkar (21) and Shakib Al Hasan (13) got into the double figures.For the UAE, Mohammad Naveed and Amjad Javed captured two wickets each for 12 and 34, respectively while Mohammad Shahzad and Rohan Mustafa took one wicket each.The next match will be played between the two arch rivals, Pakistan and India, on Saturday at the same venue.
